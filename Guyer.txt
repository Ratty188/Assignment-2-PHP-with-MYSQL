Tasks: Did the HTML portion of the assignment (built a form to submit) which was simple. Then spent a while trying to get the form to submit data to MySQL. Figuring out the prepare, bind, and execute statements was tricky but the lectures helped. A lot of my troubles dealt with getting the syntax correct.

Tasks: Once I was able to get data into the table I had a bit of an issue getting it out. My main issue was the usage of ' and " at different places. Also, since there is little help debugging, a large portion of my time was spent searching for tiny errors such as having a ] at the end of a line instead of ). I also spent a portion of this time searching for a way to update table using buttons. Luckally I found a guy that used a form to delete a row so I expanded upon that concept.
